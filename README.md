#### An interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

#### The live deployed dashboard can be found here: [Dashboard](https://giovannahayes.github.io/Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboard/)
#### The Dashboard html code can be viewed here: [index.html code](https://github.com/giovannahayes/Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboard/blob/main/index.html) along with the javascript [app.js code](https://github.com/giovannahayes/Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboard/blob/main/app2.js).

#### The [dataset](https://github.com/giovannahayes/Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboard/blob/main/samples.json) reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

#### We created a bar chart, bubble chart, gauge chart and an additional informational dashboard with the information from the dataset, shown below:

## Dashboard: Bar Chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in the selected IDs ea
* Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart
* Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart
* Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart

## Dashboard: Bubble Chart displays each sample found in the selected ID
* Use otu_ids for the x values
* Use sample_values for the y values
* Use otu_ids for the marker colors
* Use otu_labels for the text values

## Dashboard: Gauge Chart plots the weekly washing frequency of the selected ID

## Dashboard: Demographic Information Display the sample metadata found in the selected ID
* Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object
